<p>
	<b>Reinforcement Learning</b> comes under the Machine Learning.
</p>

<p>
	<b>The Machine Learning has the following kinds:</b>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Supervised Learning</b></li>
		<li><b>Unsupervised Learning</b></li>
		<li><b>Reinforcement Learning</b></li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
	<b>Reinforcement Learning</b> is a type of Machine Learning where an agent learns how to behave in an environment by performing certain actions and learning from the results of those actions.
</p>

<p>
	When the agent takes action, it gets the reward on the basis of the result. This way the learning process continues depending on the positive and the negative reward.
</p>

<p>
	The learning is based on the interaction with the environment. The agent discovers which action will give the maximum reward. Depending on that, the agent takes action.
</p>

<p>
	The following quote is true for the Reinforcement Learning: 
</p>

<blockquote>
	When it is not in our power to determine what is true, we ought to act in accordance with what is most probable. - Descartes
</blockquote>

<p>
	<b>The following are the important components of the Reinforcement Learning:</b>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Agent</b> - The one who takes the action.</li>
		<li><b>Environment</b> - Where the agent takes the action.</li>
		<li><b>State</b> - The situation in which the agent is.</li>
		<li><b>Action</b> - The thing which is done by the agent.</li>
		<li><b>Reward</b> - The measurement of success or failure of the action taken by the agent.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
	The Reinforcement Learning loops around the state, action, and reward.
</p>

<p>
	The agent takes the action depending upon the state and gets the reward on the basis of that.
</p>

<p>
	<b>There are the different approaches to the Reinforcement Learning:</b>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Value-based</b></li>
		<li><b>Policy-based</b></li>
		<li><b>Model-based</b></li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
	<b>There are two trade-offs in the Reinforcement Learning as follows:</b>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Exploration</b> - Finding more information about the environment.</li>
		<li><b>Exploitation</b> - exploiting to maximize the reward.</b></li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>This is <b>Reinforcement Learning</b>. That's it for now.</p>
