<p>
	<b>Regularization</b> is a technique which is used to solve the overfitting problem of the machine learning models.
</p>

<h3>What is overfitting?</h3>

<p>
	Overfitting is a phenomenon which occurs when a model learns the detail and noise in the training data to an extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new data.
</p>

<p>
	So the overfitting is a major problem as it negatively impacts the performance.
</p>

<p>Regularization technique to the rescue.</p>

<p>
	Generally, a good model does not give more weight to a particular feature. The weights are evenly distributed. This can be achieved by doing regularization.
</p>

<p>
	<b>There are two types of regularization as follows:</b>
	<ul>
		<li><b>L1 Regularization or Lasso Regularization</b></li>
		<li><b>L2 Regularization or Ridge Regularization</b></li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h3>
	L1 Regularization or Lasso Regularization
</h3>

<p>
    L1 Regularization or Lasso Regularization adds a penalty to the error function. The penalty is
    the sum of the <b>absolute</b> values of weights.

<p>
	<code>p</code> is the tuning parameter which decides how much we want to penalize the model.
</p>

<h3>
	L2 Regularization or Ridge Regularization
</h3>

<p>
    L2 Regularization or Ridge Regularization also adds a penalty to the error function. But the penalty here is
    the sum of the <b>squared</b> values of weights.
</p>

<p>
	Similar to L1, in L2 also, <code>p</code> is the tuning parameter which decides how much we want to penalize the model.
</p>

<p>This is <b>Regularization</b>. That's it for now.</p>
